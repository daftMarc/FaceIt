FaceIt is a simple universal application (iPhone and iPad) for iOS. I learn how to draw with Core Graphics and how to use a Split View Controller. <br/><br/>
This application is the result of Stanford University course "Developing iOS 9 Apps with Swift" : https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961 


## Basic concepts
- Understanding MVC boundaries
- Creating a new subclass of UIViewController
- Universal Application (i.e. different UIs on iPad and iPhone in the same application) Split View Controller
- Navigation Controller
- Segues
- Drawing with UIBezierPath and/or Core Graphics
- CGFloat/CGPoint/CGSize/CGRect
- Gestures
